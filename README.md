## üß† OOP Concepts Used

| Concept       | Implementation                                                                 |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Abstraction   | Interface `ExpenseOperations` defines abstract expense-related operations       |
| Inheritance   | `Expense` class inherits from `User` class                                       |
| Encapsulation | `ExpenseItem` class hides data fields and provides access via methods           |
| Polymorphism  | Interface methods implemented in the `Expense` class                             |
