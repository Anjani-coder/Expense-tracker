# 💰 Expense Calculator App (Java Console Project)

This is a simple **Expense Calculator** built using **Java OOP concepts**. It allows users to add, view, and calculate total expenses through a console-based menu. The project demonstrates the use of **abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation**, and basic object-oriented programming techniques.

- ➕ Add expenses (up to 10).
- 📋 View all recorded expenses.
- 💵 Calculate the total amount spent.
- 📦 Uses Java interface, inheritance, and encapsulation principles.

## 🧱 OOP Concepts Used

- **Abstraction**: Implemented using the `ExpenseOperations` interface.
- **Inheritance**: `Expense` class inherits from the `User` class.
- **Encapsulation**: Expense details (category, amount, date) are encapsulated within the `ExpenseItem` class.
